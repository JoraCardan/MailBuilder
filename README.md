## Description
A simple Email Builder which allows you to create an email (In Development so far.)

Contains:

* ES6 - 7 Support with Babel
* Redux dev tools to help you keep track of the app's state
* Routing
* a webpack production config so you can build the app and make it ready for production
* Sass support, just import your styles wherever you need them
* eslint to keep your js readable



## Run the app

0. ```npm install```
0. ```npm start```

Once running, if you want to hide the redux dev monitor: ```CTRL+H```

This will build the app into the "dist" directory in the root of the project. It contains the index.html along with the minified assets, ready for production.
